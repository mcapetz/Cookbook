## ["Carbon Conscious Cooking"](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U9S1lap8wrQw6qgcsXipqx_he9DPJK3Q/view) by Margaret Capetz

### Why I wrote:
If we donâ€™t act now, we will face irreversible changes to the planet we call home. The ripple effect of our warming climate has dangerous implications that are largely overlooked. I combined my passion for sustainability with my love of cooking and wrote this cookbook to share my favorite plant-based recipes, in hopes of making plant-based eating more accessible and interesting for all. My cookbook aims to ***scale the impact*** of my individual cooking.

### How I created:
Design Thinking guided my creation through the 5 stage process of ***empathizing, defining, ideating, prototyping***, and testing. I empathized by discussing with friends and family, then defined the user needs of sustainability, simplicity, and versatility. I ideated the novel concept of including a visible comparison of sustainable vs. non-sustainable ingredients in a easily-digestible graph for each recipe. I prototyped my design using Adobe InDesign, Lightroom, and Acrobat. I tested my cookbook by receiving feedback from friends, family, and endorsers. Well-known climate activists, professional cooks, and members of my community provided invaluable help and input. 

### Who I impacted:
I published my cookbook on Paperturn.com for free to increase accessibility. I reached ***3000+ views*** in ***45+ countries*** in the span of one year.
